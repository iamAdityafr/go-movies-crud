# Movie CRUD API in Go

This project is a simple **CRUD API** built using **Go (Golang)** that allows you to manage a collection of movies. It implements basic operations such as **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, and **Delete** for movie records. The API supports movie data with fields like **Title**, **Director**, **Language**, **Rating**, and **Production Company**.
